Interfaces

Interfaces are not a built-in concept like they are in languages like Java or C#.
Instead, you can use abstract classes with abstract methods to achieve 
interface-like behavior. 
The zope.interface module provides a way to define interfaces, which are 
essentially abstract classes with a specific naming convention.

Using Abstract Classes as Interfaces

To use an abstract class as an interface, you can define an abstract class with 
abstract methods, and then have other classes implement these methods. 
This approach is commonly used in Python.
