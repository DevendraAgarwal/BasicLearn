Use Cases for Tuples in Python:

Data Storage: Store fixed, immutable data, such as configuration settings 
    or metadata.
Function Return Values: Return multiple values from a function as a tuple.
Data Structures: Use tuples as building blocks for more complex data structures,
    such as graphs or trees.
